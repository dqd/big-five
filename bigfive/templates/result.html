    <h1>{% block title %}{% translate 'Your Big Five personality test traits results' %}{% endblock %}</h1>

    <p>{% blocktranslate with created=answer.created|date %}This report, completed {{ created }}, estimates the individual's level on each of the five broad personality domains of the Big Five model.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Personality traits describe, relative to other people, the frequency or intensity of a person's feelings, thoughts, or behaviors. Possession of a trait is therefore a matter of degree. We might describe two individuals as <em>extraverts</em>, but still see one as more extraverted than the other. This report uses expressions such as "extravert" or "high in extraversion" to describe someone who is likely to be seen by others as relatively extraverted.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktranslate with sex=answer.get_sex_display|lower age_group=answer.get_age_group_display %}The computer program that generates this report classifies you as low, average, or high in a trait according to whether your score is approximately in the lowest 30%, middle 40%, or highest 30% of scores obtained by people of your sex and roughly your age ({{ sex }}, {{ age_group }}). Your numerical scores are reported and graphed as <em>percentile estimates</em>. For example, a score of "60" means that your level on that trait is estimated to be higher than 60% of persons of your sex and age.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Please keep in mind that "low," "average," and "high" scores on a personality test are neither absolutely good nor bad. A particular level on any trait will probably be neutral or irrelevant for a great many activities, be helpful for accomplishing some things, and detrimental for accomplishing other things.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktranslate %}As with any personality inventory, scores and descriptions can only approximate an individual's actual personality. High and low score descriptions are usually accurate, but average scores close to the low or high boundaries might misclassify you as only average. On each set of six subdomain scales it is somewhat uncommon but certainly possible to score high in some of the subdomains and low in the others. In such cases more attention should be paid to the subdomain scores than to the broad domain score. Questions about the accuracy of your results are best resolved by showing your report to people who know you well.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <h2>{% translate 'Extraversion' %}</h2>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}<em>Extraversion</em> is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy being with people, are full of energy, and often experience positive emotions. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented, individuals who are likely to say "Yes!" or "Let's go!" to opportunities for excitement. In groups they like to talk, assert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Introverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of extraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and disengaged from the social world. Their lack of social involvement should <em>not</em> be interpreted as shyness or depression; the introvert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert and prefers to be alone. The independence and reserve of the introvert is sometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or arrogance. In reality, an introvert who scores high on the <em>Agreeableness</em> dimension will not seek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    {% if answer.results.extraversion < low %}
        <p>{% blocktranslate %}Your score on <em>Extraversion</em> is low, indicating you are introverted, reserved, and quiet. You enjoy solitude and solitary activities. Your socializing tends to be restricted to a few close friends.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    {% elif answer.results.extraversion > high %}
        <p>{% blocktranslate %}Your score on <em>Extraversion</em> is high, indicating you are sociable, outgoing, energetic, and lively. You prefer to be around people much of the time.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>{% blocktranslate %}Your score on <em>Extraversion</em> is average, indicating you are neither a subdued loner nor a jovial chatterbox. You enjoy time with others but also time alone.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

They enjoy the excitement of crowds. Low scorers tend to feel overwhelmed by, and therefore actively avoid, large crowds. They do not necessarily dislike being with people sometimes, but their need for privacy and time to themselves is much greater than for individuals who score high on this scale.

    <h2>{% translate 'Agreeableness' %}</h2>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}<em>Agreeableness</em> reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are therefore considerate, friendly, generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and trustworthy.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}<em>Agreeableness</em> is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people.

    </ul>

    <h2>{% translate 'Conscientiousness' %}</h2>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}<em>Conscientiousness</em> concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses. Impulses are not inherently bad; occasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on our first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of play rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be fun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful, fun-to-be-with, and zany.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Nonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts not only harm other members of society, but also can result in retribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate rewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include excessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job, hurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important relationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually destroy one's health.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes a person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively disallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which would have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences of steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are therefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}A hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings from earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face of short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an alternative label for the <em>Conscientiousness</em> domain. Prudent means both wise and cautious. Persons who score high on the <em>Conscientiousness</em> scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics. Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded as stuffy and boring. Unconscientious people may be criticized for their unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within the lines, but they will experience many short-lived pleasures and they will never be called stuffy.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

He suggested that everyone shows some signs of neurosis, but that we differ in our degree of suffering and our specific symptoms of distress. Today neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings.

    <p>{% blocktranslate %}People high in <em>Neuroticism</em> are emotionally reactive. They respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and their reactions tend to be more intense than normal. They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. These problems in emotional regulation can diminish a neurotic's ability to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively with stress.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    <h2>{% translate 'Openness to experience' %}</h2>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}<em>Openness to experience</em> describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people. Open people are intellectually curious, appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be, compared to closed people, more aware of their feelings. They tend to think and act in individualistic and nonconforming ways. Intellectuals typically score high on <em>Openness to experience</em>; consequently, this factor has also been called <i>Culture</i> or <i>Intellect</i>. Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of <em>Openness to experience</em>. Scores on <em>Openness to experienc</em>e are only modestly related to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on the individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the many visual or performing arts. People with low scores on <em>Openness to experience</em> tend to have narrow, common interests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with suspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use. Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and resistant to change.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who are often themselves open to experience. However, open and closed styles of thinking are useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the open person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed thinking is related to superior job performance in police work, sales, and a number of service occupations.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
