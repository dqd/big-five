"The journey of the Big Five personality traits model to becoming a "

"Gordon Allport and his colleague H. S. Odbert hypothesized that the "
"fundamental traits of human personality could be extracted from the language "
"we use to describe people. They started by identifying thousands of words in "
"the English language that described personality traits."
msgstr ""

#: bigfive/templates/index.html:97
msgid ""
"This initial list was refined over the decades by various psychologists, "
"notably Raymond Cattell in the 1940s and 1950s. Cattell used factor "
"analysis, a statistical method, to reduce the extensive list of traits to a "
"more manageable number. However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that "
"the Big Five model as we know it today began to take shape. Researchers Paul "
"Costa and Robert McCrae played a pivotal role in this. They used factor "
"analysis on personality survey data and consistently found five broad "
"factors, which they labeled as <em>Openness to experience</em>, "
"<em>Conscientiousness</em>, <em>Extraversion</em>, <em>Agreeableness</em>, "
"and <em>Neuroticism</em>."
msgstr ""

#: bigfive/templates/index.html:99
msgid ""
"The Big Five model gained momentum in the 1990s as a large body of research "
"began to validate its applicability across different cultures and languages, "
"establishing it as a universal framework for understanding personality. This "
"universality was a significant leap forward, as it suggested that these five "
"dimensions could encompass the breadth of human personality traits."

"<em>Openness to experience</em> describes a dimension of cognitive style "
"that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, "
"conventional people. Open people are intellectually curious, appreciative of "
"art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be, compared to closed people, "
"more aware of their feelings. They tend to think and act in individualistic "
"and nonconforming ways. Intellectuals typically score high on <em>Openness "
"to experience</em>; consequently, this factor has also been called "
"<i>Culture</i> or <i>Intellect</i>. Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best "
"regarded as one aspect of <em>Openness to experience</em>. Scores on "
"<em>Openness to experienc</em>e are only modestly related to years of "

"Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for "

"Depending on the individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic "
"cognition may take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, "
"artistic and metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, "
"or one of the many visual or performing arts. People with low scores on "
"<em>Openness to experience</em> tend to have narrow, common interests. They "
"prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the complex, ambiguous, "
"and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with suspicion, regarding "
"these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use. Closed people prefer "
"familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and resistant to change."

"Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, "

"closed thinking is related to superior job performance in police work, "
"sales, and a number of service occupations."
